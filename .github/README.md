# Investment Flow Algorithm

## How It Works

On execution of the investment.c source code file, a user is prompted to enter a string literal conforming to the question asked and then the string literal will be processed and verified. 

On successful verification, the user is being promted to input the amount he choses to invest which must be greater than $1000 and less than $500000.  

On successful processing and verification of the input amount, the user's investment returns will be calculated at 20% ROI and then the total deposit amount plus the 20% ROI will be printed to the user after an investment duration time of 5 seconds.
